## Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity Wireframes
1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are basic, simplified sketches that outline the general layout, structure, and functionality of a product. They focus on concepts rather than details, often using placeholders like boxes and lines for images, text, and buttons.

# When Used:

*Early in the design process to brainstorm ideas.

*To quickly explore multiple design options.

* To communicate initial concepts with stakeholders without spending too much time on visuals.

Example: A hand-drawn sketch or a grayscale wireframe showing a header, body content, and footer without specific fonts or images.

2. High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and polished representations that closely resemble the final product. They include visual details such as typography, spacing, colors, and sometimes interactive elements.

# When Used:

* Later in the design process after ideas have been validated.

* To test usability with real users.

* To provide developers with a clearer reference for building the final product.

Example: A digital wireframe in Figma or Adobe XD with styled buttons, actual text, and realistic image placements.

## Type of Wireframe in the Figma File

The provided Figma file represents a high-fidelity wireframe. Unlike low-fidelity sketches that focus on basic structure, this wireframe includes detailed design elements such as colors, typography, real images, icons, and interactive components.

1. Why it’s High-Fidelity:

* Uses actual images and text instead of placeholders.

* Shows realistic navigation flow between screens (e.g., login → home → details → reservation).

* Demonstrates final UI elements like buttons, forms, and icons.

2. Purpose in the Design Process:

* Useful for usability testing since it closely mimics the final product.

* Helps stakeholders visualize the end result.

* Provides developers with a clear reference for implementation.
