Real-World Scenario: Wireframing Revealing Usability Issues

During the early design phase of an e-commerce mobile application, the team created wireframes to map out the checkout process. Initially, the checkout screen placed the shipping address form, payment details, and order summary all on a single long page.

1. Identified Usability Issue

* When stakeholders and testers reviewed the wireframe, they noticed that:

* The page was overly cluttered, making it overwhelming for users.

* Important actions like “Confirm Order” were buried at the bottom, forcing users to scroll through multiple sections.

* Mobile users risked abandoning the checkout due to frustration with the long form.

2. Resolution

Before moving into development, the team adjusted the wireframe to break the checkout into three separate, step-by-step screens:

* Shipping Information

* Payment Details

* Order Review & Confirmation

Each screen had clear navigation buttons (“Next” and “Back”), reducing cognitive load and guiding users through the process more smoothly.

3. Impact on the Final Product

* The streamlined flow improved usability and reduced cart abandonment rates.

* Developers received a clearer, structured reference, saving time during implementation.

* Users reported higher satisfaction with the app during usability testing, leading to stronger adoption rates.
