## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, low-fidelity visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on the placement of elements, navigation, and functionality rather than colors, images, or final design details.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

* Wireframing plays a critical role in the design process because it:

* Clarifies structure and functionality: Helps designers and stakeholders understand how different components of a product fit together.

* Saves time and resources: Identifies potential usability issues early, reducing costly changes later in development.

* Improves collaboration: Provides a visual reference that aligns the design team, developers, and clients.

* Enhances user experience: Ensures the productâ€™s layout and flow support user needs before moving to high-fidelity designs.
